# CAMEMBERT: Comparing Atmospheric Models of Extrasolar Mini-neptunes Building and Envisioning Retrievals and Transits

This repository for the CAMEMBERT MIP holds the initial conditions as well as scripts for analysing the GCM data generated by the project.  The actual GCM data can be found at 

https://ckan.emac.gsfc.nasa.gov/organization/cuisines-camembert 

which will open to the public upon the release of the first results paper.   Pre-publication access can be arranged by contacting Duncan Christie (d.christie@exeter.ac.uk).
